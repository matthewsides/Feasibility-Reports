## Feasibility Reports Definition
A feasibility report is a document that assesses potential solutions to the business problem or opportunity, and determines which of these are viable for further analysis.

## Purpose
The purpose of the feasibility report as highlighted above, is to present the project parameters and define the potential solutions to the defined problem or opportunity. Furthermore once a set of solutions have been layed out or brain stormed, the potential solutions are then expanded upon, providing sufficient detail, including very high-level costing information, the solutions deemed viable are then taken to the approving authority for further analysis. Project constraints and limitations of expenditure are among the various factors that will determine viability.

### Requirement Gathering

Requirement Gathering is essentially the act of collecting the requirements of a system from user's, customers and other stakeholders. 

Furthermore during this phase an analysis of the current  market's requirements and features that are in demand are covered, delving into the supply and demand aspect of the market seeing whether there is a real need for the software that is being developed in the current market. This essentially molds the requirements.

### Structure 



### Intended audience 

The intended audience essentially links to 

### Functional and Non Functional requirements 

### User requirements 


### Constraints



## Feasibility Report Components

A feasibility report can be broken down into 4 diffrent segments or sections pertaining to; 

### Proposed Project Description 

This segment is for essentially defining and describing the proposed project or business venture, which lays the foundation for analysis.Furthermore going into detail and outlining the timelines,deliverables and resource requirements of a proposed project. 
Though if the report is analyzing a business, the report should detail the products and services that the business will offer, the proposed target market and the resource needs introduced by the business model (this part essentially focuses on the requirements of implementing the venture).

### Market Analysis Section

This section analyses the industry and market targeted by the proposed venture. Moreover measuring the size of the market and its demographic makeup using census data or other survey sources. Further for defining  a target market according to certian characteristics, analysing any businesses or projects within the same bracket and determining with this infomration as to whether there is a truly viable market for this business or project and if it is possible to compete. 

### Technical Feasibility Section

The Technical Feasibility Section essentially covers as to what the requirements are for specialized equipment or facilities, copyrights, patents, labor and expertise for the venture, also determining whether the required resources are on hand or are reasonably obtainable.Inaddition for any resources not on hand the costs of attaining and retaining them are considered.

### Financial Feasibility Section
The Financial Feasibility segment is basically outlining and determining how much the proposed project or business start-up will cost to implement, as well as how much it can be expected to earn. In addition this section condisers all the resources, capital investments required, calculating any financing requirements that may or will arise, analysing any potential sources of financing avaliable.

Moreover ascertaining whether the project or business can be expected to earn a consistent profit and whether the person or  business currently has the financial capability or capacity to go through with the venture.

## Impact of different feasibility criteria 

In regards to the impact of different feasibility criteria on a software investigation, the technical critera is critical since the software will be written using equipment and machines, whilst the implementation and testing in particular heavly relys on theses machines to create the software as well as the ID's in which the software will be written in, therefore outlining the resources that are availiable and needed has a huge impact on time specifically as equipment required but not yet attained during the implementation will stall production thus causing the other criterias to be affected as well and other core activities to be affected.

The impact of the financial and economic feasibility is extensive as if it is not first analysed in a software project or any project as to whether the project will make enough money and weighing the lossess with the gains as to how much it will cost to go through with the project, it could cause the project to be canccelled due to the over excessive nature of the project or lossess to be occurred, whilst this also affects the other areas or feasibility criterias. In addition the Financial impact is more likely to affect the implementation phase rather then the design phase as that is where most of the costs of a project will factor in.

Further exploring the impacts of different feasibility criteria on a software investigation the anaylsis of the market or demographic the project is targeted at is crucial as it essentailly affects the finicial gains linking into the financial feasibility which connects or links to the other feasibilitys, whilst it can also determine whether the project is worth starting or if a certain demographic should be targeted for the software (based on what the software is supposed to do).

Inadditon the impact of the project criteria on software management is massive  since the project  is what essentially lays the foundation for anaylsis as with out the project criteria it would not be clear or obscure as to what the project is about or trying to achieve, whilst the other areas would also be affected as the project criteria defines how much money would be needed, equipment, who to target, etc.

Moreover operational feasibility will also be determental as it is critical to define whether the system helps or improves operations, also linking into to the market as to what similiar software programs would be out there and how to differentiate the software and essentially solve the problem of operational feasibility (how it works/ is it required / does it improve operations).
